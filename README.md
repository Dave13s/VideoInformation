# VideoInformation
This is a little utility that gathers information about all compatible video formats(using the DirectShowLib) 
within a folder and outputs basic information about them, including duration, height, and width, 
useful for sorting large amounts of videos.

## Install

Just pull, then run. Select the parent folder you would like to search, the utility will search that and any subfolders for all compatible video files. Should work on extremely large video libraries(3TB+) you'll have to be patient though...

## TODO

 - Unit Tests
